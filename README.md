## Description

Quickly save blog post titles for inspiration and later use, without clogging up your database with drafts.

All In The Title adds a widget to the Dashboard that can be used to store great blog post ideas; the ones that first exist as just a title in your mind, before they get fleshed out into fantastic blog posts.

Without any pressure to write even a single line of the post content, you can save titles for future inspiration. Then with a single click from the widget you can quickly create a draft for a title when you're ready to write, or delete a title that doesn't work for you any more.

By default, all of the saved post titles can be seen by other users; you can keep a particular idea private by simply checking a box when submitting a new title.

Happy blogging!
